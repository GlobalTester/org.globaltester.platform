GlobalTester offers an integrated test environment with a holistic \
approach to testing that covers test specification, test execution, \
test evaluation, detailed failure analysis and reporting. All \
conformity tests can be customized and extended by user-defined \
tests through GlobalPlatform scripting. Customers can either \
develop customized test suites on their own or ask the HJP experts \
to develop test suites for them.\n\
