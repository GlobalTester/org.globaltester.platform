	<h1>Add a new Plug-in</h1>
	<p>
		Whenever additional functionality is only optional for GlobalTester
		and can be decoupled from the existing plug-ins it is a good idea to
		start a new plug-in project. You will find some hints when to start a
		new plug-in and when to add to an existing one in our <a
			href="../concepts/devGuidelines.html">development guidelines</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Create plug-in project</h2>
	<p>To create a new plug-in project from scratch start the "New
		Project" wizard. In Eclipse, select "Package Explorer" view "New >
		Project" and there use "Plug-in Project" and click "Next".</p>
	<p>
		In the following screens fill in the project name, plug-in ID and
		related data.
		You will find several hints regarding the values
		to use here in our <a href="../concepts/devGuidelines.html">development
			guidelines</a> Again.
	</p>
	<p>When the basic plug-in structure is created you can start to
		implement the code just as ordinary Eclipse plug-in development.
		Remember to add a second plug-in project containing a fragment to your plug-in
		which includes all your tests.</p>
	<p>
		For your plug-in to be available during execution and Buckminster
		provisioning it, it  must be added to a feature that is referenced from the
		Buckminster entry point. Add it to the features where your plug-in fits
		or <a href="../tasks/addFeature.html">add a new feature</a> if none
		fits.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Integrate plug-in in source control and build processes</h2>
	<p>TODO</p>
	<p>Integration will be handled mostly by Buckminster, but for 
		Jenkins / Buckminster to update included plug-ins they need to be 
		configured in the relevant jenkins builds as used SVN source.</p>
		
	<h2>Consider UI dependencies</h2>
	At the moment, we have UI dependencies in our *.doc projects for our online help.
	If you implement a non-UI plug-in, please make sure it has no dependency on any *.doc project.
