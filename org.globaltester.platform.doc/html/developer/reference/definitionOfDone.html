	<h1>Definition of Done</h1>

	<p>This page is intended as quick overview of the Definition of
		Done used throughout the whole GlobaltTester project. All current
		commiters to GlobalTester agreed on the following definitions and see
		them as requirements to every part of their work. This ensures overall
		quality and guarantees a common understanding of how much work is
		still left to particular tasks.</p>
	<p>As the development process evolves this definition should
		evolve too. So whenever there are any inconsistencies or other issues
		regarding fulfillment of these definitions, please don't hesitate to
		discuss them on the next developer meeting or by e-mail. As a rule of
		thumb before breaking one of these rules it should be discussed and
		either the rule or the users workflow should be changed (remember that
		changing this definition still requires consensus among the
		developers).</p>
	<p>Currently our workflow defines only three major steps when to
		speak of "Done", this is once for every commit, once for the
		completion of particular feature and once for each officially released
		version. For each of this steps the definition of done is slightly
		different but they all depend on each other. Also the borders between
		them are not very precise.</p>

	<h2>Commit</h2>
	<p>A commit is the smallest part of work that adds a new functionality
		or a bugfix to the existing codebase. The goal for each commit should
		be a new working functionality, while not breaking anything available
		before.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Code compiles</b> without compile time errors and mostly
			without warnings. This means that all appearing compiler warnings
			should have been dealt with and only those should remain in a commit
			that are unavoidable by modifications to our code. Suppressing
			warnings should be used as a last resort only if no other option is
			available.</li>
		<li><b>Code works</b> as expected, this means at least manually
			tested. Already covered by automated tests would be even better, but
			with our current workflow this is not yet achievable for every single
			commit. A single commit should always add some kind of functionality,
			which not necessarily matches a whole feature or user story. This
			added value should be very clear from the log message as the
			subdivision of the feature in several commits is not always obvious.



		
		<li><b>Code is readable</b>, this implies a self-review by the
			commiter just before the commit. Special care should be taken about
			readability of code (including spell- and grammar checking),
			documentation including JavaDoc and code comments, speaking names for
			methods and variables and a descriptive commit comment. For a more
			detailed description on these topics and the standards we want to use
			in GlobalTester also see our <a href="../concepts/devGuidelinse.html">Development
				Guidelines</a>.</li>
		<li><b>Code is complete</b> regarding the functionality defined
			in commit message. This means that all contained code also includes
			the required error handling, all "Auto-generated ..." Tasks are
			removed (and handled properly) and the only tasks that remain in the
			commited code should be assigned to the commiter and just a forecast
			to the upcomming commits. (This means Tasks in the code should not be
			used for long-term reminders but just for very short periods.)</li>
		<li>The <b>Boy Scout rule</b> states that every part of code that
			is touched should be commited to the repository in better state than
			it was checked out from the repository. This especially implies that
			if understanding some part of the code was difficult this part should
			be changed (or commented). After all the work of understanding that
			part is already done, the only work left is to communicate that
			understanding to the following developers. (This only applies for
			code touched anyhow. If you stumble across some code that needs
			maintenance don't hesitate to bring it into better shape but this
			should not be mixed up with some other commit.)</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Feature</h2>
	<p>The definition of a feature to be done requires all contained
		commits to be done according to the definition above. It also
		includes several additional requirements. Most of these are easier met
		when completed already in an early state of development (e.g. tests should
		be written as early as possible) so the following list should be
		referenced throughout the whole implementation process and some of the
		concerns should be addressed by commits as early as possible.</p>
	<p>The main idea of a "done" feature should be potentially
		shippable. So whenever a release should be made all done features will
		be included in that release.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Desired functionality completely implemented</b>, there
			should be no open issues, no remaining tasks, no missing parts, no
			development stubs and so on.</li>
		<li>A <b>Peer Review</b> should have taken place for every part
			of the new feature including code, tests and documentation. This
			makes sure that the overall quality of our code base always stays in
			good shape.</li>
		<li><b>Acceptance tests</b> should exist and pass. Currently we
			use SWTBot and JUnit as only test frameworks. Therefore the tests
			itself need to be accepted and it needs to be checked that those
			tests cover all aspects of the current feature.</li>
		<li><b>Test coverage</b> should be as high as possible. In
			contrast to the requirements for a commit this means that now JUnit
			tests for all Non-UI-Classes and SWTBotTests for all parts of the UI
			should exist and should be integrated in the automatic build. This
			ensures that the new feature stays working throughout the following
			development.</li>
		<li><b>Documentation and UserAssistance</b> needs to be completely
			written and all required screenshots should come from the appropriate
			GUI tests so that they can easily regenerated upon modification.</li>

	</ul>
	<h2>Release</h2>
	<p>After features are done they get bundled to new releases. This
		process always depends on manual decision, when to release and what
		parts to release. As each feature which is declared to be done is
		potentially shippable only the combination of features and the actual
		build needs to be considered during this step.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Version numbers and version history</b> should be updated
			properly and be reviewed by at least one other developer. The version
			number of a given bundle is only increased during actual release
			process. Declaration of features as done does not justify version
			changes until the actual release is declared!</li>
		<li><b>Integration tests</b> need to be performed. This should be
			a manual test suite which ensures correct version numbers, correct
			user assistance and documentation, and all aspects that are not
			covered by the tests defined for the features. Also all included
			features should be roughly rechecked to make sure that no
			functionality got broken during release build. In order to make sure
			the released version really works on the target platform these tests
			need to be carried out with a fresh installation from the build
			product release candidate. If no issues arise with that release
			candidate during this test exactly that build is relabeled to be the
			actual release.</li>
	</ul>
