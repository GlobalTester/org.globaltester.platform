	<h1>Get the code</h1>
	<p>All required source code is held in the central GlobalTester
		Subversion repository. Access to this repository is controlled by secunet
		Security Networks AG and you may get an account by sending a request via eMail
		to support@globaltester.org.</p>
	<p>
		The central repository currently can be accessed using the following
		URL <a href="http://subversion/repo/globaltester">http://subversion/repo/globaltester</a>.
		This can currently only be accesed from within the secunet private network.
		A public access for this is planned and will be listed here when
		available.
	</p>
	<p>After you have configured your access to the server (using your
		credentials) you will see a wide variety of plug-in / feature projects.
		Each of them represents a small part of the available GlobalTester
		functionality. But don't be afraid you won't need to handle this
		complexity manually.</p>
	<p>Just checkout the project com.hjp.globaltester.releng to your
		workspace. This is the main release engineering project and it defines
		several Buckminster CQUERYs and MSPECs that can be used to populate
		your workspace with all you need (almost) automatically. To populate
		your workspace with the components you need select the according
		CQUERY or MSPEC, right-click it, and select "Buckminster > Import...".
		This will fire up a wizard that guides you through the process.</p>
	<p>The first thing you need to get into your workspace is the
		target platform. This ensures that you develop against the correct
		target definition and makes sure that no non-GlobalTester components
		get materialized inside your workspace instead of inside the
		targetplatform. To get it import the targetplatform.mspec use
		Buckminster. Double-check that you import the MSPEC not the CQUERY,
		this ensures that your targetplatform is setup according to the
		automated build infrastructure. Please make sure that this is the
		first target you materialize before any other CQUERY. Be aware this
		will take a while and you will see only the Eclipse-Feature-Project
		org.globaltester.targetplatform materialize in the workspace while the
		plug-ins that make up your target platform will be materialized to a
		hidden directory. (The hidden directory is named within the
		targetplatform.mspec so you can take a look at what happened, but
		please do not change anything here, as it most probably will break the
		build infrastructure).</p>
	<p>In order to get the source of plug-ins to work with you will
		need to materialize at least one other CQUERY into your workspace.
		Below you will find a list of interesting Buckminster targets and what
		they are used for. Depending on your subscription you might not be
		able to import all of them (although you can see the Buckminster
		definitions).</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>File</th>
			<th>Usage</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>targetplatform.mspec</td>
			<td>Get the correct targetplatform downloaded and set up to
				develop with. To materialize the targetplatform always use the MSPEC
				as it ensures the correct setup in accordance with the build
				infrastructure.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>globaltester_rcp.cquery</td>
			<td>Component query that describes everything needed to get a
				minimal GlobalTester as standalone RCP application.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>After you have materialized the required sources in your
		workspace they are simple Eclipse-plug-in-Projects. They are already
		correctly linked with the SVN-Server using your credentials. So you
		can begin and work with them as with any other SVN-Project. Use the
		TeamSynchronizing perspective to sync with the repository update,
		commit and merge as you need. When updating sources introduces new
		dependencies you can invoke Buckminster again and it will fetch the
		required projects for you.</p>
	<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
	<p>If you experience problems while materializing a CQUERY, check the used
		repository location and the line </br>
		&lt;rm:uri format=&quot;http://{0}subversion/repo/globaltester/{1}/trunk/?moduleBeforeTag&amp;amp;moduleBeforeBranch&quot;&gt;.
		</br> in the globaltester.rmap file.
		The repository location and the format have to match, because the automatically
		inserted authentication is bound to the url of the repository. You can adjust the
		format to your repository location, just preserve the {0}.
