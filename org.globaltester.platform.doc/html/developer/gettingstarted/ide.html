	<h1>Get an IDE</h1>
	<p>
		As GlobalTester is based on Eclipse RCP we also use Eclipse as our
		IDE. You can either get a recent package from eclipse.org and install
		the required plug-ins on your own or get a prepared Eclipse
		installation from HJP Consulting which already includes all required
		and suggested plug-ins, see section <a href="#preparedEclipse">Get
			prepared Eclipse installation</a> for details.
	</p>
	<p>
		To set it up on your own go get a recent package from <a
			href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a>.
		Just unzip it to a location of your choice and fire up the executable
		inside and install the required plug-ins as listed below.
	</p>
	<h2>Required plug-ins</h2>
	<p>To get the code and handle it you will need at least the
		following plug-ins:
	<ul>
		<li>PDE (this may be already included, depending on the package
			you chose to download)</li>
		<li>Buckminster</li>
		<li>Subversion integration (choose whichever you want, we use
			Subversive)</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<h2>Optional plug-ins</h2>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>WebPageEditor (for editing documentation)</li>
		<li>JUnit (for unit testing)</li>
		<li>SWTBot (for testing UI)</li>
		<li>WindowBuilder (for easier design of UI)</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<h2>

	</h2>
	<p>
		You can get a zipped Eclipse installation already including all
		mentioned required and optional plug-ins from <a
			href="file://Y:/Java Tools/Eclipse/eclipse-SDK-3.6.2-gt-dev-default.zip">Y:/Java
			Tools/Eclipse/eclipse-SDK-3.6.2-gt-dev-default.zip</a>. Currently this is
		only available for win32 and only accessible from within HJP
		Consultings private network.
	</p>
	<p>We use little out-of-date version of Eclipse, which is the
		oldest one GlobalTester states to support. By this we make sure that
		you don't get confused by hints in the online help or similar that
		won't work when compiling against the fixed target platform.</p>
