	<p>TODO</p>
	<p>GlobalTester is hosted at two sites. The free software part is
		hosted at TODO. This is what you can access and work on without
		further restrictions.</p>
	<p>
		secunet participates in the development on TODO while still
		keeping an internal mirror which adds several customer-related
		features. This internal mirror is used to build the versions
		officially provided on globaltester.org and to our customers. secunet
		commits to keep the versions in the mirrored part of the internal
		repository synchronized to those versions found on TODO. We try to
		keep repository and issue tracking as synchronized as possible so that
		the open source community can benefit from the work of secunet as fast as
		possible and vice versa. If you are a customer of secunet and interested in
		an account to participate in the development please refer to <a
			href="customerAccess.html">Get customer access</a>.
