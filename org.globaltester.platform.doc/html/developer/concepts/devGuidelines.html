		<ul>
			<li>Private fields in a class can be used by this class directly, without using a corresponding getter/setter</li>
		</ul>

	<p>TODO - Default values in plug-in meta-data (secunet Security Networks AG
		for commercial, GlobalTester Community for community plug-ins???)</p>
	<p>TODO - when to start a new plug-in and when to add to an existing
		one</p>
	<h2>Java and Eclipse Versions</h2>
	<p>
	GlobalTester is supposed to be able to be used with the current and preceding Eclipse and Java version.
	Right now Eclipse 3.6 (Helios) and Java 1.6 should be used. Any new plug-ins, Bundles, Fragments, etc. should satisfy this condition.
	Dependencies to Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo) or Java 7 should be avoided.
	</p>
	
	<h2>SVN Repository Structure</h2>
	<p>
	The directory &quot;Trunk&quot; should be underneath the projects.
	This way ensures that versions can be tagged for the single plug-ins and no ambiguous tags can appear in the whole repository.
	If you share a project, please make sure you follow the intructions in our <a href=" ../tasks/shareProjectOrFragment.html">help tasks</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>Launch Configurations</h2>
	<p>
	The launch configuration &quot;GT3_RCP&quot; should exactly represent the state, which is in accordance with the completed Jenkins build.
	If you want to use your own plug-ins, please use the launch configuration &quot;GT3_SDK&quot;.
	This one starts GlobalTester with all plug-ins in your workspace enabled in a full-fledged Eclipse IDE.
	Your own plug-in will be integrated to the product by adding it to the according feature. 
	Please make sure you use an Eclipse target platform and not the GlobalTester target platform.
	</p>
