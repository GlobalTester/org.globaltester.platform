	<h3>What's new in GlobalTester 3.2.2</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>PersoSim based EAC1-ePassport simulation
		<p>GlobalTester now includes protocol implementations to allow simulation of EAC1 ePassport based on PersoSim technology.
		Additionally PersoSim logging was integrated in the GlobalTester test logfiles in order to allow detailed failure analysis.
		Based on these changes several ActiveAuthentication related testcases have been fixed that showed minor issues with specific APDUs received from terminal.
