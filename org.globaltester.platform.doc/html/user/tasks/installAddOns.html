	<h1>Install AddOns</h1>
	<p>There are several different AddOns available that extend the
		functionality of GlobalTester. For example there are different export
		filters for TestSpecifications available which brand the output
		according to the users corporate identity and other plug-ins add new
		test specifications to the list of importable specs. In the future HJP
		will provide bigger packages that bundle several TestSpecifications
		together with their implementation and all required artifacts (e.g.
		protocols and data structures) in order to perform conformity testing
		of e-passports for example. Depending on their size and relevance to
		different users they come in two different forms.</p>
	<p>
		When they are large (meaning consist of several related plug-ins)
		and/or relevant to more than just a few users they will be packaged as
		features within their own update site. This update site will be
		accessible vie http or as zip-file for offline usage. You can easily
		install features from such sites by selecting <b>&quot;Help -$gt;
			Install new Software...&quot;</b>. The opening dialog you can either
		select pre-configured update sites or add your own sites and install
		features from them.
	</p>
	<p>
		When the AddOn is small and relevant for only a small group of users
		it will be available as single plug-in within a p2 repository (e.g. a
		zip file). Installation of this kind of AddOn currently requires
		manual execution of the p2 director from the command line. You will
		need the p2 repository containing the bundle you wish to install and
		the bundle id. Both will be provided to you by the vendor of the
		AddOn. So download the repository file and store it locally on your
		disk. Now execute the p2 director with the following command line:<br/><br/>
		<code >&lt;globaltester executable&gt; -application
			org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director -repository &lt;URL of the repo&gt;
			-installIU &lt;bundle id&gt;</code><br/><br/>
		To install the ePassport BAC sample testscripts on a Windows machine using
		GlobalTester as a RCP application for example use the following command:<br/><br/>
		<code>globaltester.exe -application
			org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director -repository
			jar:file:/C:/develop/org.globaltester.testspec.icao.bac.sample.p2.zip!/
			-installIU org.globaltester.testspec.icao.bac.sample</code><br/><br/>
		To install the ePassport BAC sample testscripts on a Windows machine using
		GlobalTester as a plugin for example use the following command:<br/><br/>
		<code>eclipse.exe -application
			org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director -repository
			jar:file:/C:/develop/org.globaltester.testspec.icao.bac.sample.p2.zip!/
			-installIU org.globaltester.testspec.icao.bac.sample</code><br/><br/>
	</p>
	<p>	
		When the installation performed successfully restart Eclipse to use the new
		plug-ins.
